## Authentication Usage

- [Salting & Hashing](#hash)
- [Logging In](#login)
- [Protecting Routes](#filter)
- [Retrieving The Logged In User](#user)
- [Logging Out](#logout)

> **Note:** Before using the Auth class, you must [specify a session driver](/docs/public/session/config).

<a name="hash"></a>
### Salting & Hashing

If you are using the Auth class, you are strongly encouraged to hash and salt all passwords. Web development must be done responsibly. Salted, hashed passwords make a rainbow table attack against your user's passwords impractical.

Don't worry, salting and hashing passwords is easy using the **Hash** class. The Hash class provides a simple way to hash passwords using the **bcrypt** hashing algorithm. Check out this example:

	$password = Hash::make('secret');

The **make** method of the Hash class will return a 60 character hashed string.

You can compare an unhashed value against a hashed one using the **check** method on the **Hash** class:

	if (Hash::check('secret', $hashed_value))
	{
		return 'The password is valid!';
	}

<a name="login"></a>
### Logging In

Logging a user into your application is simple using the **attempt** method on the Auth class. Simply pass the username and password of the user to the method. The login method will return **true** if the credentials are valid. Otherwise, **false** will be returned:

	if (Auth::attempt('example@gmail.com', 'password'))
	{
	     return Redirect::to('user/profile');
	}

If the user's credentials are valid, the user ID will be stored in the session and the user will be considered "logged in" on subsequent requests to your application.

You probably noticed this method name corresponds to the **attempt** function you [configured earlier](/docs/public/auth/config#attempt). Each time you call the **attempt** method on the **Auth** class, the **attempt** function in the configuration file will be called to check the user's credentials. It all makes sense now, right?

> **Note:** To provide more flexiblity when working with third-party authentication providers, you are not required to pass a password into the **attempt** method.

To determine if the user of your application is logged in, call the **check** method:

	if (Auth::check())
	{
	     return "You're logged in!";
	}

Sometimes you may need to login a user without checking their credentials, such as after a user first registers to use your application. It's easy using the **login** method. Just pass your user object or the user's ID:

	Auth::login($user);

	Auth::login(15);

<a name="filter"></a>
### Protecting Routes

It is common to limit access to certain routes only to logged in users. It's a breeze in Laravel using the built-in [auth filter](/docs/public/start/routes#filters). If the user is logged in, the request will proceed as normal; however, if the user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the "login" [named route](/docs/public/start/routes#named).

To protect a route, simply attach the **auth** filter:

	'GET /admin' => array('before' => 'auth', 'do' => function() {})

> **Note:** You are free to edit the **auth** filter however you like. A default implementation is located in **application/filters.php**.

<a name="user"></a>
### Retrieving The Logged In User

Once a user has logged in to your application, you may easily access the user model via the **user** method on the Auth class:

	return Auth::user()->email;

This method simply calls the [**user** function](/docs/public/auth/config#user) in the configuration file. Also, you don't need to worry about performance when using this method. The user is only retrieved from storage the first time you use the method.

> **Note:** If the user is not logged in, the **user** method will return NULL.

<a name="logout"></a>
### Logging Out

Ready to log the user out of your application? It's simple:

	Auth::logout();

This method will remove the user ID from the session, and the user will no longer be considered logged in on subsequent requests to your application.
